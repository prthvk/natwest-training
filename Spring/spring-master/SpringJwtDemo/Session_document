	Spring Framework

Enterprise applications(Highly complex systems)

What are J2EE applications?
	They are basically large multi user applications that can manipulate massive data,network 
	distributed resources, and complex logic.

Components J2EE

-Application clients and applets are client components
-Java Servlet and java server Pages(JSP) technology components are web components
-Enterprise Java Beans (EJB) components are bussiness components.

Client tiers , middle tier, data tier(often called the enterprise information systems tier)

	Client tier-
	
	- Application clients
	- request to the server
	- Clients can be a web browser, a standalone application, other services

	Web tier-
	 - Servlets , Jsp, Jstl


 Client - Server - (Application server ,Web Server (tomcat) - Glassfish
		(Web + Bussiness (EJB))



Drawbacks
	- Complexities - Writing code was very complex, it was tighly coupled.
	- Lots of XML files needs to be written, for even basic ejb lots of XML files
		(deployment descriptor)
	-It took ages to deploy or redeploy the application.
	-Hard coded dependency version compatibility
	-Lots of configuration
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


What is Framework?

1)Framework are large bodies(usually many classes) of predefined code to which we can add our own code to solve a problem in a specific domain.


Benefits-
1)Framework are based on architectures and designs and they force you to follow a specific architecture.

2)They force you to follow an already optimized and less issues prone design for your applications.

3)so the classes or the apis which will be provided by framework is going to be efficient , secure
less expense, 


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Why Spring Framework?

1) Spring is framework of framework.

2)The crux of the framework is a concept called DI or Inversion of Control(IOC).

3)Enables the developers to develop the enterprise applications using POJOs(Plain old Java Object).
  enterprise container(application congtainer) we are uisng web server(tomcat).

4)Spring Framework is both complete and modular, because spring has a layered archotecture.

5)Well designed web MVC framework 
6)Spring is light weight

7)End to End development - 


-------------------------------------------------

Spring Modules

1) Spring core - (Base module)
2) Spring JDBC - (Persistence logic)
3)Spring AOP - (for cross context logic)
4)Spring Transaction ( For Transaction support)
5)Spring ORM - (Object Relational mapping)
6) Spring Web MVC( web Mvc)


----------------------------------------------------

Core container


1)Beans, core, context, SpEl


The core and beans modules provide the most fundamental parts of the framework and provides
 The IOC and DI features.

Context - module is build on the solid base provided by the core and beans modules.
It provides a  way to access objects in framework- style manner. It is a medium to access 
any object defined and configured

SpEl- Expression Language - this modules provides a poweful expression language for querying and manupulating objects at run time.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Spring IOC - Inversion of Control - DI(Dependency Injection) is implemented in the Spring by Inversion of Control(container)

 1)Creating Objects - Control over the objects construction is given to the Spring container.
 
The Spring IOC container by using java pojo classes and configuration metadata producces afully configured and executable System or application.


Two types -
BeanFactory, ApplicationContext.

Spring 
---------------------------------

1) Add depencencies in pom.xml
2)Create the class  - src/main/java(source file), Hobby and Student(Hobby)
	List of Hobbies injected into Student Object
3)src/main/resource - beans.xml 
4)Main - we craeted object of ApplicationContext (Spring IOC container)

DI
	1)Constructor Injection
	2)Property Injection


Bean - Init and destroy

When a bean is instantiated, it may require to perform some initialization to get into a usable
state. 

Init ----- destroy

no more XML

java Based Annotation and Configurations

@Bean and @Autowire @Component @ComponentScan-

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Spring MVC -

An introduction to Spring MVC
Models in Spring MVC
Controllers in Spring MVC
Handling data in Views


Spring MVC , Front Controller Design Pattern


MVC is design pattern which provides a solution to layer an application by seperating Business(Model), Presentation (View) and Control Flow(Controller).

The model contains the businees logic
The controller is responsible for the redirection and interaction between view component and model
The view component contains the presentation part of the application.

This design pattern helps us to develop loosely coupled application by segregating various concerns into different layers.


view takes the model as the input render to the approprate end user.

The controller is responsible for handling the request and generating the model and selecting the appropriate view for the request.


Front controller design pattern
------------------------------------------

This design pattern enforces a single point of entry for all the incoming request.

All the requests are handled by single piece of code which can further delegate the responsibility of processing the request to further application objects.


1) Servlet - DispatcherServlet - configure this 


1) Spring MVC module is based on front controller design pattern followed by MVC design pattern.

2)All the incoming request are handled by single servlet named DispatcherServlet which acts as front controller in Spring MVC module.

3)The DispatcherServlet then refers to the HandlerMapping to find a controller object which can handle the request.


4) DispatcherServlet then dispatches the request to the controller object so that it can actullay perform the business logic to fulfil the user request(Controller may delegate the responsibility to further application object known as service objects).

5)The controller return the encapsulated object containing the model object and the view object(or a logical name of the view).

6)In Spring MVC, this encapsulated object is represented by Class ModelAndView.

7)In Case of ModelAndView contains the logical name of the view, the DispatcherServlet refers to ViewResolver to find the actual view Object(path) based on the logical name.

8)DispatcherServlet then passes the model object to the view Object which is then rendered to the end user.


-----------------------------------------------------------

1) webApp - maven webapp
2)Add Spring MVC dependency on POM.xml
3)Configure DispatcherServlet - Servlet - web.xml (deployment discriptor file)
4)HandlerMapper - springdispatcher-servlet.xml
	component-scan
	Declare bean InterResourceViewResoler @Bean - /WEB-INF/views/xxxx.jsp
5)Create package - create a Controller class
	@Controller - is a Sprcialization of Springs @Component stereotype annotation, this class 	will be automatically detected by Spring container as part of conatiners scanning process.
	Also @Controller is specialized for HTTP communication.

	This controllers have flexible method signature and do not have to extend any base class 	or need not implement any interfaces.

       @RequestMapping - the method of the @requestmapping indicates The HTTP method type.
	Annotation is used to map request to controller method.It has various attributes to match the url.
	RequestMapping - GET,POST,DELETE,PUT etc...
	Spring 4.3 introduced method level variants, also known as composed annotations
	@Getmapping , @PostMapping wrapper over @requestMapping(method=get)

	ModelMap is a class, which gives us ability to pass a collection of data or values to render a view.

6) index.jsp - WEB-INF/Views - index.jsp

used SpEl language to show the user name.

7) ViewResolver provides mapping between view name and actual views.
  XMLViewresolver , ResourceBundleViewResolver .
 
  Thmyeleaf , freemarker, veocity ect...

We are uisng jsp as Spring framework has a built in integration for Spring MVC with jstl and Jsp.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Steps to configure Tomcat


https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IGexsf0T-lDGZN-lsyhu7fImYmZ63i-KoffpPgsrOzc/edit?usp=sharing



-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Spring MVC Crud operation:
JSTL tags
JSP tags - scritping tags

<%= for loop>
<% employee.get(o)%>

url - http:localhost:8080:projectname:deleteEmployee?empId=101


Update button in index.jsp

once u click - it will call controller

  create a new 

form action = updatedata
 empid - 101
empname - 
empemail - 
empcontactNo - 
submit

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


 Spring ORM
 ORM
 Hibernate as ORM
 Data Access using Hibernate
 Spring WebMvc - Hibernate (ORM) - Mysql
 Spring web mvc - JDBCTemplate - Mysql

 JDBC - 


   Mysql - 
	1)Create database - query
	2)Create table - 


  1) Load the driver class - com.jdbc.mysql.Driver - type -IV
  2)get The connection - DriverManager - url - jdbc:mysql:localhost:3306
  3)Specify the SQL statement - Statement , preparedStatement, CallableStatment
  4)Declare parameters and provide the parameters value
  5)prepare and execute the statemnet.
  6)Set up the loop to itearte through the resultSet.
  7)process any exception - SQLException
  8)Handle the transaction - commit , rollback, savepoint
  9)close the connection, statemnet, resultset.


Bottleneck

Low - level operation will be taken care by Spring ORM

ORM - Object relational Mapping refers to the technique of mapping data between an object model representation to a relational data model representation

ORM tool simplifies the data creation, data manipulation and data access.

ORM internally uses the JDBC API to interact with the database.

 Do not write query


Hibernate API


Hibernate is a Java Framework that simplefies the development of java application to interact with database. It is an open source , lightweight, ORM tool.
hibernate implements the specification of JPA(JAVA persistence API) for data persistency.


Some advantages
	1)database independent query - HQL(Hibernate Query Langauge) is it the object oriented version of SQL. 

	2) Automatic table creation : hibernate frameworks provides facility to create the database automatically.

	3)Simplfies the complex join.

	4)mapping of classes - Student has hobby


  Hibernate mapping - XMl mapping

	5)SessionFactory object - for one appication u need only one sessionFactory object (one databases).

	6) Session Object- A session is used to get a physical connection with a databses.
 	each time you interact with database u need session object
	
	Configuration - SessionFactory - Session - CRUD
	7)Transaction Object - A transaction represents a unit of work with the database and most of the RDBMS supports transaction Functionality.
		JTA


	----------------------------------------------------------------
	
	
	1) NO xml in the code
	1)this is maven archetype - webapp
	2)Add dependency in pom.xml file - 
	3)no xml - Configuration 
	4)com.stackroute.springmvc.configuration
		1)DispatcherServlet (WebAppInitializer)
		2)InternalResourceviewresolver - AppConfig (ApplicationConfiguration - 
					all the beans)
			
		3)properties of mysql
		4)configuration hibernate (sessionFactory , Transaction)


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     5) Entity - Employee - This class will get store in db
     6)Dao class - repository
     7)Create controller
     8)Index.jsp



     6)Dao getSessionFactory
		getSessiinObject
		getTransactionObject
		openTranscation
		save , update , delete
		close the transaction

	


  hibernate Configuration - Appconfig - Hibernate
	Spring configurations - Webconfig - InternalViewresolevr



Spring application ---------ORM(Hibernate)-------------------- Mysql
							(SQL query)
(no sql query)                 SQL query (JDBC)


	insert into table values (empid , empname) -----
	Employee - int id, String name

		Table - Employee (id , name)

	Table - Employee - ID, name
				101 , john
				102 , Jenny



-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Webservices
RESTapis
Spring Boot


first possibility - make my trip they have access to database of airlines

2nd possibility - all the airlines are dumping there database to makemy trip in every half hr.

3rd posibility - exposed their services through an apis , vendors are communicating those services 


 Web services - services avialbale over the web.
		enables platform independent communication between applications over the web
		provides a standard protocol or format for communication.


  2 ways to implement them
	
	SOAP - Simple Object Access protocal
	Medium - Http (POST)
	Format - XML

	REST - Representational state transfer
	Medium - HTTP (POST,PUT,DELETE,GET)
	Format - JSON or text


	Resource , URI ,HTTPverbs (metadata - (request,response,Httpstatus) - it is also about resource representation.

	Richardson Maturity Model - RMM 


	Level0,1,2,3


	Level 2 



	Action		Httpverbs	URI

	Check		GET		api/v1/bankingservice/account

	Open		POST		api/v1/bankingservice/account/{id}

	Close		DELETE		api/v1/bankingservice/account/{id}

	Withdrwa	PUT		api/v1/bankingservice/account/{id}


	Level 3 - hateos

Api in our Spring Boot - 



	It is very easy to develop Spring Based applications with Java
	It reduce lots of development time and increase the productivity
	It avoids lots of boilerplate code (AppConfig) , annotations, xml as well
	No XML 
	It is very easy to integrate with Spring ecosystem - Spring JDBC, ORM, DATA ect
	It provide embedded HTTP server tomcat , jetty 
	It provides lots of plugins to work with embedded and in memory database.
	Spring follow the conventions over configuration



CRudRepository - CRUD
Relational Database - JpaRepository - ORM(hibernate) - JBDC - Mysql 
 MongodB             MongoRepository - Nosql (Mongodb)
Graph database Ne04J - Neo4jRepsoitory

@RestController Spring 4- - the response is not going to be any view page but a json data.

@Controller + @RequestBody

Loggers 

What is AOP(Aspect oreinted programming)
Why AOP
Terminologies in AOP
Spring AOP



Why to implement loggers in our application?
	- to degug
	- to check the error
	- to see what output we are getting
	- (System.out.println -to check output and also debug)
		-- PMD  - project mistake detectors - SOP is one of the voilations - serious 
		-- Code is too clumsy
		-- no level to debug
	- warn , debug , info , error
	- produce better output and metadata which helps to troubleshoot the prob.
	- date , classes , methods (format ) - log to some file

Log4j , SLF4j (Simple logging facade for java) - is an API designed to give generic access
to many of logging frameworks , log4j as well.

What is Log4j
	- this is simple , flexible and fast java based logging framework.
	- Logger - it is used to log the msges
	- Appender - It is used to publish the logging information to the destination like file,
			databse , console etc..
	- Layouts - It is used to format logging information in different styles.



Logging level - 



All<TRACE<DEBUG<INFO<WARN<ERROR<FATAL<OFF

logging level - info
msges with following scope will only be logged - INFO , WARN , ERROR , FATAL.


Spring boot application will classpath
resources 
logback.xml
logback-spring.xml


apllication.yml - placeholder for your mongodb -
in intellij - edit configurations

env.varible.sh - 


Steps for loggers in the application

1) No dependency
2) Inside ur controller or service or any layer -
	- Get the Object of logger - Loggerfactory
	- do all loggings try with all the levels
	- log,error - should be inside the catch
	- Color combinations - for differnt levels
	- logback.xml file - which will have appenders, patterns, level-info.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is AOP(Aspect oreinted programming)
Why AOP
Terminologies in AOP
Spring AOP


AOP will say concentrate on ur bussiness logic as supporting logics are Cross cutting concerns
that will be provided by AOP.

Logging , security,Transaction , Authentication , Authorization - Cross cutting concerns
will be taken by AOP.behavious 

Spring AOP -

1) In any enterprise application, there are no of concerns which needs to be taken care in addition to business logic.
These concerns are spread across the application and into multiple application layers. Logging etc..

2) main feature of Spring AOP . aggregrate section (bolierplate codde)  of code that would be repeated in multiple places in ur application.

3)By removing the boilerplate code ur business code will be more cleaner.


jargans

1) Aspect - A module which has set of APIs providing cross cutting requirements.

2)Join Point -This represents a point in ur application where u can plug in AOP aspect.

	


3) Advice - This is actual action to be taken either before or after the method execution.
This is actual piece of code that is invoked during program execution by Spring AOP framwork.

 Types of advices -
		1)@before - Run advice before the method execution
		2) @After - Run the advice after the method execution regardless of the outcome.
		3)AfterReturning - run the advice after the method execution only if method completes succesfully

		4)After -throwing - Run advice after the method execution only if method exists by throwing an exception
		5)Around - before , after , after returning


4) Point cut - this is set of one or more joinpoints where an advice should be executed.
		you can specify the pointcuts using expressions or patterns.


1)@Before
2)@AfterThrowing
3)@AfterReturning
4)@After


@value - use this to remove all hard coded values from ur code
	use application.yml or application.properties - key and value - 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Test cases
	- Repository
	- Service
	- Controller

CI - (Continous Integration)


 test our Apis - postman - manual.
 Automated test cases for repository, service and controller


1) Repository layer - Integration test cases which was working with real DB.
 
 Unit test - it is a testing method by which individual units of source code are tested to determine if they are ready to use. It helps to reduce the cost of bug fixes .

Integration verifies that your code works with external dependencies.

@RunWith(SpringRunner.class) - This annotation tells Junit to run the test cases using Spring testing support.
It enables full support of Spring context loading dependency injection of beans in the test.


    Employee emp  = repoesitory.findByid(id).get();


@Before - @Test -@After

 it will go on for all test cases.

 2 list - list.get(0) - track1 - trackid
          list.get(1) - track2 - trackid


-------------------------------------------------------------

Service layer - pure unit test - A pure unit test should not have any external dependencies.
 We can handle such scenarios using mocking, since repository is an external dependency, we can mock it

We do mocking for behaviour verifaction It menas that the mock object verifies that it (the mock object)is being used correctly by the object under test.


Mockito is a framework which can be used in conjuction with Junit.

Mockito allows us to create and configure mock objects. Using mockito simplefies the development classes with external dependencies significantly.


if we use mockito in test we typically
	- Mock away external dependencies and insert the mocks into the code under test.
	- Execute the code under test.
	- validate that the code executed correctly.



@WebMvc - annotation allows testing the controller layer.
	When we use this annotation the entire Spring application context is not loaded .
	Instead Spring scans for only @Controller and @restController 
	also auto configures MOCKmvc . 
MockMVC - offers a powerful way to quickly test MVC controllers without need to start a full Http server.



postman - http :localhost:.... httprequest - to handle httprequest - u need server - tomcat


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CI  -  Continous Integration


Ci is developemnt practice that requires developers to integrate code into a shared repository several times a day.

CI increases code quality withour extra burden on developers.


Why we do CI

run the test in real world
increase the code coverage
easy to deploy the appliocation at the earliest
decreases code review process


CI practices
maintain a single resource repository
make ur build sefl-testing


Advantages 


Gitlab offers a CI service - add .gitlab-ci.yml - CI pipeline  - 
inside the root - pom.xml
touch .gitlab-ci.yml

.gitlab-ci.yml are hidden files  - Ctrl-h - all hidden files will be visible


test cases - build the jar

mvn test
mvn package

repository layer - dependent on some db (mongo)

jre -
mvn 



image: openjdk:10-jre - image - jre10 will be pulled from dockerhub

runners to run this CI pipeline - runners 




------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Docker - 

Container technology to build, ship and run any app anywhere.

Challenges in Sotware shipping

We say its working for me not sure why its not working for u


 Work Docker stuff only in ubuntu  - vlabs


Docker -components

1) docker image - class

	- A read only template
	- Usually derives from multiple base images that are layers stacked on top of each other .

2) docker container - object

	- A runnable instance of a docker image
	- Can be created , started , stopped and deleted.




Angular -node js
Spring - java, maven
db - mongo, mysql
Dockerize ur application .



I do not need these sofwres still I wont to run the application

Spring Boot + mongo - 

steps 

1) Dockerize my databse - mongodb.

	-- Pull the mongodb image from Dockerhub - image is build by dockerfile
	-- dockerfile - some steps to create the image
	-- Create and run the container
  --( Mongodb will be dockerize - container of db will run)

2) Dockerize my backend - Spring Boot - jre(this is dockerhub)

	-- I need to create the image
	-- Create map my backened container with mongodb container and run the application

 --( Spring boot application is dockerized and it will be connected with mongodb)

3) I will send request from postman - 



 employeeMongo:v1 - basic crud operation
 employeeMongo : v2 - crud + AOP


docker pull mongo - mongo:latest
docker pull mongo:3.2 xenial


dockerfile - read the file ---> image ----> run the conatiner

1) docker pull mongo:tag - latest - get from dockerhub

2) docker image ls


3)sudo docker run -d --name mongocontainer -p 27017:27017 mongo:latest

	Commands
		-- docker ps  - it will show all the containers (running or not running)
		-- docker ps -a it will show all the running containers


		status
			exist(1) non running conatiners


2) Spring boot  - there is no image available in dockerhub

 		- create the dockerfile 
		copy jar file and paste inside the image usr-src

commands

1) docker pull mongo - to get mongo image
2)docker run -d --name mongocontainer --p 27017:27017 mongo:latest
3)docker image ls - it will show all the images
4)docker container ps - all the containers
5) docker logs containerid
6) create the dockerfile for Spring boot
7)docker build -t employeedb-image . --> this will read ur dockerfile 
8) check image is created or not
9) docker run -d --name springcontainer --network=host employeedb-image
10)docker container ps - all the containers
	-- two containers are up with status - 
11) send request from postman - containerized spring + containerzised mongodb.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Spring Security in our application (JWT) - (JSON web token)

Framework which providdes security features like authentication, Authorization to create enterprise application..


JWT - Compact - because of their smaller size, jwts can be send through a url, POST parameter, or inside the HTTP header.
